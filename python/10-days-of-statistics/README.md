# Context
This repository includes all of my scripts for the [Hacker Rank 10 Days of Statistics challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics). I purposefully coded these challenges in base Python 3 to practice the language. Below, I have linked to descriptions of each challenge for ease of reference.

# Day 0
* [Mean, Median, and Mode](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-basic-statistics)
* [Weighted Mean](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-weighted-mean)

# Day 1
* [Quartiles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-quartiles)
* [Interquartile Range](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-interquartile-range)
* [Standard Deviation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-standard-deviation)

# Day 2
This day's challenges were all calculating probabilities to understand the rules of probability, but did not include explicit coding challenges.
* [Basic Probabilities](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1)
* [More Dice](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-2)
* [Compound Event Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-3)

# Day 3
This day's challenges were also like Day 2's, with no explicit coding challenges.
* [Conditional Probability](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-4)
* [Cards of the Same Suit](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-5)
* [Drawing Marbles](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-6)

# Day 4
* [Binomial Distribution #1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-binomial-distribution-1)
* [Binomial Distribution #2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-binomial-distribution-2)
* [Geometric Distribution #1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-geometric-distribution-1)
* [Geometric Distribution #2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-geometric-distribution-2)

# Day 5
* [Poisson Distribution #1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-poisson-distribution-1/tutorial)
* [Poisson Distribution #2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-poisson-distribution-2/problem)
